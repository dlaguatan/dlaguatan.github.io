        <p>How can I show power? This question was the driving force behind most ancient works of art. Subtle, and not so subtle iconography was implemented to validate positions of power, as well as send a message to enemies that the ancient civilization was not to be provoked. Small hand gestures, intimidating inscriptions or mythical beasts were some of the ways in which ancient Egypt displayed their power. However, one question always lingered in my mind. How does a beard represent power, and why are they so important to pharaohs? In my reading of Writings from Ancient Egypt by Toby Wilkinson, it seemed like the only explanation to my question was that beards were simply part of the culture. So I investigated further.</p>
        
        <p> Upon my visit to The Metropolitan Museum of Art, I searched for the answer to my question. I focused on the depiction of gods and rulers to see how the representation of their beards differed. Then, after hours of looking at officials of various rankings, my friend made a seemingly childish joke. “It kind of looks like a penis.” Well, maybe it does, and maybe it was intentional. I discovered there was educational value to this joke through the Egyptian depictions of body hair, their history of castration and the varying styles of beards used to create hierarchies of power. </p>
