        <article id="three">
        <p>My friend's joke came to life after viewing the Head from an Osiride Statue of Hatshepsut. This statue of Hatshepsut depicted the female pharaoh as she transformed into Osiris and was originally carved into a temple. What really stood out to me in the museum was how different this beard was compared to the ceremonial beard we see in the Sphinx of Hatshepsut, since my original assumption was that beards were important because of the tradition attached to them. In the Osiride statue, the beard is much longer and thinner than the ceremonial sphinx depiction. So the conclusion I came to was that size matters.</p>
        
        <p> We know that Egyptians used hierarchy of scale, meaning that making things bigger meant they were more powerful. In this case, they did not just make the beard bigger, they made the beard longer and appear more phallic in nature. Even though it was the same pharaoh, they decided that simply making the ceremonial beard larger wouldn’t make her seem more powerful. This was a depiction of a god, so the Egyptians likely idealized the proportions of the statue and this is how they wanted to display supreme divine power. This is interesting because it differs from traditional Egyptian iconography of bigger is better. Especially for female pharaohs, it was important to include a beard when creating statues. Since cutting off a man’s credentials was representative of removing their source of power, attaching a large one to the face of a female pharaoh created the idea that they still harnessed the same authority. It’s not just saying they’re masculine, but it sends the message that the female pharaohs have all the same parts and qualifications as a male pharaoh.</p>
        
        <p>I also noticed an emphasis on the length of a beard in the text The Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor. In this text, the sailor encounters a massive snake on an island after his ship crashed and he explains that “The trees were breaking and the ground was shaking. I uncovered my face and discovered it was a snake that had come – he was thirty cubits (long) and his beard was more than two cubits” (Wilkinson, 248). The author made sure to not only include the length of the snake, but also to include the length of its beard. They intentionally added the length to add to the authority of the snake. At The Met, I even saw lower ranking officials, like the priest in the Coffin of Irtirutja, have tiny beards attached to their coffin. This connection could signify how Egyptian society deemed longer beards more authoritative or qualified, which connects to the quantitative values placed on men. Through textual evidence and the online images, the beards appeared very similar to me. I was only able to make this distinction between the beards because of the detail I could notice in person.</p>
