        <p>At the entrance of The Met rests the Colossal Seated Statue of a Pharaoh with intricately carved hieroglyphs strewn around the throne. There's an immense amount of detail put into each aspect of King Amenemhat II, we see the muscle definition in the arms and legs, each finger and toe is proportional, and small lines contour the headpiece. Each detail was put there with intense thought and was intended to be eternal, yet there was a clear lack of body hair. Originally I believed the beard represented masculinity because males are able to grow more body hair, but if that was the case then why isn’t there hair anywhere else on the body?</p>
        
        <p> There was no chest hair, no arm hair, not even a mustache. It was no accident. In fact none of the depictions of gods or pharaohs were represented to be hairy. A beard is typically considered manly because hair growth is associated with testosterone levels, thus people equate hairiness with manliness. Currently, many people view the epitome of a man to look like a viking or a lumberjack. Yet the Egyptians couldn’t have thought this way because they would’ve included body hair to make the powerful people they’re representing seem more masculine, and therefore the value of a beard isn’t that they can grow one, it’s that it represents what society can’t actually see. It is their royal way of flexing their numbers.
